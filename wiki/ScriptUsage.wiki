In order to run the script just execute the script by typing ./tmntv(version).py and type help at the option command prompt the output will exactly that:

||Usage: Type a single option then press enter type file name press enter again for help type help for the turtle type ban!||

|| *Options* || *Functionality description* ||
|| help    ||   Print help message for script arguments ||
|| sfx     ||   For mutating SQL injection attack strings by adding suffixes to the payloads e.g EXEC, ';-- e.t.c ||
|| pfx     ||   For mutating SQL injection attack strings by adding postfixes to the payloads e.g. --, );-- e.t.c ||
|| url     ||   For mutating SQL injection attack strings by url encoding the payloads ||
|| flr     ||   For mutating SQL injection attack strings by filling the gaps with SQL commends, url encoded space and other special characters ||
|| b64     ||   For mutating attack strings by base 64 encoding the payloads ||
|| hex  ||   For mutating SQL injection attack strings by hex encoding the payloads ||
|| ban  ||   Print ThE script banner ||
|| ver  ||   Print version of the script ||
|| all  ||   Performing all mutations ||
|| ded  ||   Deduplicate all attack strings payloads ||

*Example 1:* Script execution for generating suffixed SQL injection payload file:

||root# ./tmntv(version).py||Command prompt input|| 
||Usage: Type a single option then press enter type filename press enter again for help type help for the turtle type ban!||Screen output||
||Enter option: sfx ||Screen output|| 
||Enter filename: filename.txt||Screen output||
||Payload is being generated please wait...||Screen output||
||Payload mutation is finished enjoy...||Screen output||
||Bye bye...||Screen output||


*Note:*The tool after properly executed will generate a file named after the mutation type and the current time so you can track the generated payloads, the file name would look like this Tue04Sep18_15_16_suffixedPayloads.lst. 

*Example 2:* Script execution for generating post fixed SQL injection payload file:

||root# ./tmntv(version).py||Command prompt input|| 
||Usage: Type a single option then press enter type filename press enter again for help type help for the turtle type ban!||Screen output||
||Enter option: pfx ||Screen output|| 
||Enter filename: filename.txt||Screen output||
||Payload is being generated please wait...||Screen output||
||Payload mutation is finished enjoy...||Screen output||
||Bye bye...||Screen output||


*Note:*The tool after properly executed will generate a file named after the mutation type and the current time so you can track the generated payloads, the file name would look like this Tue04Sep18_15_11_postfixedPayloads.lst.
