Example script execution for generating suffixed SQL injection payloads:

root# ./tmntv1.2.py 

Usage: Type a single option then press enter type filename press enter again for help type help for the turtle type ban!



Enter option: sfx 


Enter filename: p.txt

The tool after properly executed will generate a file named after the mutation type and the current time so you can track the generated payloads.
