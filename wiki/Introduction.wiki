The teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles project is three things:

# A collection of known attack patterns focused in Web Application input attacks (e.g. SQL Injections, XSS attacks e.t.c)

# A collection of error messages produced by malicious and malformed user inputs, which you can use with Burp intruder or other grep-like utilities to identify and verify vulnerabilities when fuzzing. 

# An easy to use python script that helps you to obfuscate payloads for bypassing costume Web Application filters.

It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing as well as being a useful addition to an experienced pen testers arsenal toolkit.
