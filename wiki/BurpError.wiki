Analysing fuzz data using Burp Intruder

After you successfully fuzz the targeted Web Application variables, then you would have to do some analysis on the data returned back. You can analyse the results by using the Burp three different features:

  # Grep Match 
  # Grep Extract 
  # Grep Payload

To do that after fuzzing the variables you go to Tab Options and then you process your results using the features mentioned above:

*Note:* Grep Match can help you locate the error messages within the server responses using Burp default list or your own costume error list.

*Note:* Grep Payloads can help you payload information from the server responses using Burp default lists or your own costume list. This feature is particularly useful for XSS attack, because if for example the injected script is echoed back to the user then the server is vulnerable to XSS
