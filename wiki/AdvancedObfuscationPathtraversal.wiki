A directory traversal (or path traversal) consists in exploiting insufficient security validation / sanitization of user-supplied input file names, so that characters representing "traverse to parent directory" are passed through to the file APIs. The goal of this attack is to order an application to access a computer file that is not intended to be accessible. This attack exploits a lack of security (the software is acting exactly as it is supposed to) as opposed to exploiting a bug in the code. 

== What really is a Path Traversal ==

A Path Traversal attack aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By browsing the application, the attacker looks for absolute links to files stored on the web server. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration and critical system files, limited by system operational access control. The attacker uses “../” sequences to move up to root directory, thus permitting navigation through the file system.

A Path Traversal is two things:

  # An input validation vulnerability (e.g the application allows the dot-dot-slash characters to pass through).
  # An access control vulnerability (e.g. the application has access to the OS file system with high privileges).
